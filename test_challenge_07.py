# Supermarket billing: Write a function in python that 
# takes a shopping list (dictionary of items and price) and returns the total.
# extension: apply discount accordingly:
# if total is greater than 50 Euros 5% discount.
# if total is greater than 60 Euros 6% discount.
# if total is greater than 70 Euros 7% discount and so on. 
# --> for each 10€ = 1% discount starting from 50€
