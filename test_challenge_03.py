# It takes 21 seconds to wash your hands 
# and help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
#
# Create a function that takes the number of times 
# a person washes their hands per day (n) 
# and the number of months (m) they follow this routine, 
# and calculates the duration in minutes and seconds 
# that person spends washing their hands.
#
# Examples:
# wash_hands(8, 7) ➞ "588 minutes and 0 seconds"
# wash_hands(0, 0) ➞ "0 minutes and 0 seconds"
# wash_hands(7, 9) ➞ "661 minutes and 30 seconds"
# 
# Notes: Consider a month has 30 days.

# My solution 1: 

def wash_hands(n, m):
    # n = numbrt of washes
    # m = number of months
  
    secondsPerDay = 21 * n # total seconds of washing hands per day 
    secondsPerMonth = secondsPerDay * 30  #total seconds of washing hands per month = (n * 21) * 30
    secondsTotalMonth = secondsPerMonth * m  # total seconds of washing hands for total number of months = (n * 21) * 30 * m 
    minutes = secondsTotalMonth // 60   # // converts total seconds into entire minutes =  ((n * 21) * 30 * m) / 60  ( one / is division, gives a float/digital number)
    seconds = secondsTotalMonth % 60 # divides by the integers possible and and takes the remainder

    return(str(minutes) + " minutes and " + str(seconds) + " seconds") 

# My short solution:

def wash_hands(n, m):
    return (str((((n * 21) * 30 * m) // 60)) + " minutes and " + str((((n * 21) * 30 * m) % 60)) + " seconds")


# Solution Theresa

# def wash_hands(n, m):
#     # n = number of washes
#     # m = number of months
#     oneTime = 21
#     oneDayTotalSeconds = oneTime * n
#     totalWashes = oneDayTotalSeconds  30  m
#     minutes = int(totalWashes // 60) 
#     seconds = int(totalWashes % 60)

#     return(str(minutes) + " minutes and " + str(seconds) + " seconds")
